    "description": "Originally designed for a specific table, this script was made with one-offs and LCs/Westmarches in mind.  Many APIs find difficulties in running scripts when numerous tokens are left on a table.  This script removes all tokens linked to a character sheet when using the command [!cleanup] in the chat.  It also deletes tokens when the linked character sheet is deleted.  It will ignore any tokens on a map that has the word [bullpen] in the name (not case-sensitive)",
